  collection_description: "London’s Health and Welfare is one of several collections curated by the Layers of London team at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA). These collections bring together photographs, films and estate plans from the London County Council archive collection at LMA.
                           This collection features 120 photographs which include hospitals, health centres, dispensaries, workhouse institutions, maternity homes and therapy departments. These services were established or maintained by London County Council Public Health Department after the passing of the 1929 Local Government Act. At this time, the council took on the duties of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and twenty-five Boards of Guardians of the Poor to become the overall commissioning and management body for London’s health and welfare services. It remained so until the establishment of the National Health Service in 1948. The photographs in this collection illustrate the bold and forward-looking strategy which the LCC adopted as it sought to improve the health and well-being of all Londoners.

                           <h3>About the London County Council (LCC)</h3>
                           From 1889 to 1965, the London County Council (LCC) was the top-level authority for the metropolitan boroughs of the County of London. As the most important elected authority in the country, the LCC co-ordinated, funded and directly provided a staggering range of services to people who lived in London and to the many millions who passed through the capital for work or pleasure.

                           The London County Council collection is held at London Metropolitan Archives: <a href='https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail/REFD+LCC?SESSIONSEARCH'>Collection Catalogue</a>
