  collection_description: "This collection showcases a selection of architectural records from London County Council (LCC) and Greater London Council (GLC), all of which are held at London Metropolitan Archives.  The collection includes block plans, site plans and floor plans, elevations, section drawings and a few technical drawings, such as those needed when fitting equipment into buildings. The drawings were created or commissioned by the professionals in the LCC Architect’s Department. The influence which this department had on the way that the built environment of London developed during the first half of the twentieth century is hard to over-estimate.

                           The London Building Act 1894 gave London County Council the power to appoint a “superintending architect of metropolitan buildings” to oversee the enforcement of regulations outlined in the Act. In doing so it took over all the responsibilities of its predecessor, the Metropolitan Board of Works.  Enforcement with regard to these responsibilities fell to the District Surveyors team.

                           The role of the LCC Architect soon developed.  By 1909 there were 13 Committees dealing with construction works, and 35 sub-committees. The work included the construction of housing (under the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890), including slum clearance; construction of buildings in connection with the introduction of electricity; construction of educational buildings, from nursery schools to colleges; construction of hospitals and institutions; construction of fire brigade stations; street and road improvements; maintenance and construction of bridges; public parks; Weights and Measures Stations and Gas Meter Testing Stations. Ultimately, the Chief Architect of the LCC was responsible for overseeing the design and construction of all these buildings, places and spaces, resulting in a highly distinctive look for London which is still recognizable today."
