  collection_description: "Educating London is one of several collections curated by the Layers of London team at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA). These collections bring together photographs, films and estate plans from the London County Council archive collection at LMA.

                           This collection features 132 photographs of London County Council (LCC) educational institutions and facilities. The photographs cover a range of institutions established or maintained by the LCC between 1889 and 1965, from elementary schools inherited from the Metropolitan Board of Works in the late-Victorian period to the pioneering comprehensive schools of the 1950s. These images reveal both the architectural diversity of schools across the inner London metropolitan boroughs, and the vast array of subject classes taught there; also included are photographs of nurseries, primary, secondary, central and technical and trade schools, as well as additional facilities such as training colleges, employment services and exhibitions. As a whole, the collection captures the institutional changes that occurred during this period, which reflected national changes to the education system.

                           <h3>About the London County Council (LCC)</h3>
                           From 1889 to 1965, the London County Council (LCC) was the top-level authority for the metropolitan boroughs of the County of London. As the most important elected authority in the country, the LCC co-ordinated, funded and directly provided a staggering range of services to people who lived in London and to the many millions who passed through the capital for work or pleasure.

                           The London County Council collection is held at London Metropolitan Archives: <a href='https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail/REFD+LCC?SESSIONSEARCH'>Collection Catalogue</a>
