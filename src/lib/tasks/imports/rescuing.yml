  collection_description: "Rescuing London is one of several collections curated by the Layers of London team at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA).  These collections bring together photographs, films and estate plans from the London County Council archive collection at LMA.
                           London County Council (LCC) governed London from 1889 until 1965. As part of its remit to run public services across the Metropolitan Boroughs, the Council administered emergency services such as the London Fire Brigade and the London Ambulance Service. These 124 images give an insight into these services, the buildings they worked out of, and the people who worked for them.
                           The collection also gives in an insight into the role of the LCC during wartime. In World War One (1914 – 1918), several LCC educational institutions were used as munitions factories. During World War Two (1939 – 1945), the LCC continued to assist the government in the war effort through Air Raid Precaution Measures and by recruiting volunteers to the auxiliary services. Large areas of London were heavily damaged and destroyed as a result of enemy action, especially during the Blitz (September 1940 – May 1941). The LCC Heavy Rescue Service worked hard to rescue people from bombed out buildings and the LCC War Debris Survey had the significant task of clearing rubble and wreckage from London’s streets.
                           After World War Two, the LCC continued to develop their Civil Defence services especially as tensions grew during the Cold War.

                           <h3>About the London County Council</h3>
                           From 1889 to 1965, the London County Council (LCC) was the top-level authority for the metropolitan boroughs of the County of London. As the most important elected authority in the country, the LCC co-ordinated, funded and directly provided a staggering range of services to people who lived in London and to the many millions who passed through the capital for work or pleasure.
                           The London County Council collection is held at London Metropolitan Archives:  <a href='https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail/REFD+LCC?SESSIONSEARCH'>Collection Catalogue</a>.
