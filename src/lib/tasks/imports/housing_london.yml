  collection_description: "Housing London is one of several collections curated by the Layers of London team at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA).  These collections bring together photographs, films and estate plans from the London County Council archive collection at LMA.

                           This collection features photographs of 150 housing schemes built by the London County Council (LCC) between 1889 and 1965. These images reveal the huge changes that occurred in housing design over the period, showing the newly-built estates in their prime. Yet they also capture the broader vision of the council’s architects and planners, with views of shopping parades, community halls, landscaped grounds, specially-commissioned artworks, new building methods and even the interiors of residents’ homes. The collection also includes several photographs showing areas before they were redeveloped by the LCC.


                           <h3>About the London County Council (LCC)</h3>
                           From 1889 to 1965, the London County Council (LCC) was the top-level authority for the metropolitan boroughs of the County of London. As the most important elected authority in the country, the LCC co-ordinated, funded and directly provided a staggering range of services to people who lived in London and to the many millions who passed through the capital for work or pleasure.

                           The London County Council collection is held at London Metropolitan Archives: <a href='https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail/REFD+LCC?SESSIONSEARCH'>Collection Catalogue</a>
